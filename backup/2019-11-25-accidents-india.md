This is a simple analysis of the road accidents in India in the last 25 years, through Data Visualization.

From the graph above, we can see that both the population (red) and the number of vehicles on road (blue) have been constantly increasing over the last 25 years. Which means that more and more people are able to afford vehicles over time. A single household nowadays owns more than one vehicle.



Due to this increase in population, and the number of vehicles, we certainly can expect a proportional increase in the number of accidents occurring. As expected, the total number of accidents occurring (shown in blue) has been increasing.



Now, let's look at the graph below that shows the trend in the number of accidents in the last 25 years.

The number of accidents per 1 lakh people (red) has been proportionally increasing as well.

Although, the number of accidents per vehicle (green) has been declining. This could be due to one or more of the following reasons:

1. People have become better drivers - as more people have access to/can afford vehicles now.
2. A strict imposition of traffic rules and fines has led to fewer accidents per vehicle. -> see rules imposed on news!
3. Maybe the number of vehicles has nothing to do with the number of accidents that occur.

The exact cause for this can only be determined by analysis of data on these various factors.

Not only is it important to understand how many accidents have been occurring, it is also important to know how fatal these accidents were. Here is a graph showing how the percentage of people involved in accidents, that were killed.

We see that the number of people killed has been increasing significantly since the year 2004. Around the same time when the accidents per vehicle started reducing in a less steep manner. This could mean that more fatal accidents have been occurring since 2004. Possible reasons that could be considered for this:
1. Speeding - vehicle is not really a luxury anymore at this point. So people bought fast bikes and cars. -> see news!
2. Bad quality of roads?
