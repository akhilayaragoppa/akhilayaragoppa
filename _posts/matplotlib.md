# Learning the basics of plotting in python

To familiarize myself with basic plotting and data visualization in python, I decided to learn plotting various graphs using the library matplotlib.  

Although this is a very powerful library that allows you to handle multiple images simultaneously using object oriented plotting, I found the basic plotting using pyplot, simple and sufficient for now.  

A sample of the various graphs I learned to plot can be found here in this [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/akhilayaragoppa/akhilayaragoppa.github.io/blob/master/source_code/Basics.ipynb)
