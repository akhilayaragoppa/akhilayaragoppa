A script that uses the Gmail API to delete unwanted emails.

## Backstory

I created my Gmail account when I was 14 years old. There were about 17000 unread emails when I last checked. This made it very difficult for me to see how many new emails I had received. And all these old unread emails were simply hogging space on my Gmail account. So, one day I sought to clear all unread emails in my inbox.

## Challenge with manual deletion

There is no option in Gmail to delete all emails belonging to a certain category. To delete a 1000 of them manually it took me about 30 minutes. As I had decided I needed to delete these emails, I sat down and wrote a script. Which also took about 30 minutes.

## The code itself

Here is the code that did the job :)
