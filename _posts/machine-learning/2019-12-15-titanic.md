This is an exploratory analysis of the Titanic survivors data from Kaggle.  

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.  

In this article, I will attempt to identify what category of passengers most likely survived.  

The features that can be examined for each passenger are:
1. Age
2. Sex
3. Ticket class
4. Number of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic
5. Number of parents / children aboard the Titanic
6. Passenger fare
7. Port of Embarkation

## Age
Let's first have a look at the number of survivors and non-survivors among passengers of different ages.

The following observations can be made from the graph above:
- Most passengers on the ship are in the age range 15 to 50.
- A high number of non-survivors exist in the age range 20-30.
- There are also a good number of survivors in the same age range.  
- Of the 8 passengers above the age of 65, only 1 survived.  
From the above observations, I can assume that 'age' can be used as a decision factor for evaluating passenger survival.  

## Sex
Let's now see if there is a bias in number of survivors with respect to sex of the passenger.

Observations from this graph:
- Approximately 70% of the female passengers survived.
- Only 20% of the male passengers survived.
Therefore, we can use this feature to significantly improve survival prediction of a passenger.

## Ticket Class
Next, let's see how the ticket class affected the survival chances of a passenger:

Observations from this graph:
- More than 50% of passengers with Class 1 tickets survived.
- Around 50% of passengers with Class 2 tickets survived.
- Only around 30% of passengers with Class 3 tickets survived.
This tells us that somehow even during a life/death situation like the sinking of the Titanic, people with better tickets had a higher chance of survival.

## Ticket Fare
Another graph on similar lines as the ticket class, is the graph of ticket fare.  
![](/images/titanic/fare.png)  
From the above graph, we can see that only 4 people that did not survive, paid a ticket fare above 100. Also, from the graph of non-survivors, we see that a very high number of non-survivors are concentrated around low ticket prices.  
We see that this graph affects the survival in the same way that the ticket class did. It is possible that most information given by this variable is redundant. If this were a huge dataset with many features, we could possibly ignore this feature, or generate a new feature from the 'ticket class' and the 'ticket fare'.

## Port of embarkation

### Titanic sailing route map
Titanic first arrived at Southampton, UK.  
6 days later, Titanic arrived at Cherbourg, France.  
Titanic arrived in Queenstown, Ireland a day later.  
3 days later Titanic hits the iceberg.  

Let's look at a graph of the survival variation based on the 'port of embarkation'.  
![](/images/titanic/embarkation.png)  

Observations:
- A huge number of people boarded from Southampton. This was probably because it was the first port where people boarded.
- Only about 30% of the passengers who boarded in Southampton survived.
- A small number of people boarded in Queenstown, and about 40% of them survived.
- In Cherbourg, more than 50% of the passengers survived.  This was probably because most passengers who boarded in Cherbourg had class 1 tickets.  

## Conclusion
This analysis gives us a fair idea of what factors most determined the survival of a passenger aboard the titanic. These features can be used to build machine learning models to predict the survival of a passenger. A preliminary knowledge of the data sets a much required context to tweak the features as necessary for building efficient machine learning models.

## Code
The above analysis was carried out using a jupyter notebook. The notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/akhilayaragoppa/akhilayaragoppa.github.io/blob/master/source_code/Titanic-Data-Visualization.ipynb).
